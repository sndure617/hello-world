# hello-world
Welcome to github

Hello world because that is the first thought that came to mind and i love cliches. 
My name is Sulayman Ndure i am what you can call a new programmer. I have always had 
a fancy for very difficult problem solving and the ability to make something out of nothing
i guess you can say that this kind of curiosity is what got me into programming.
I am currently moslty focused on Html and Css i hope to learn as much as i can here and be able 
to give back to the community one day.
Hope to spend countless night writing code and browsing all you wonderful peoples code.
